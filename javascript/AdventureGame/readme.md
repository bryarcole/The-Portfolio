#Title: Adventure Game 
---------------------------------
This is an adventure game that I making for my codeAcedemy project. Not inttended to be an expression of styling or design. 
My main purpose here is to show how objects can be extended and can add methods and properties to other "parent" objects.
User naviagtes the game and picks a "Class" then a "Weapon" then uses these properties to "fight" bosses via comparative operaters and Math funtions.


##User Stories:

* The game can't be the same every time on playthrough.
* Different outcomes based on different choices in the game.
* Muliple Characters.
* NPCs should interact and remember things about the main Characters
* The game should end when you win or lose
